One day an octopus was trying to cook some breakfast underneath the ocean. His name was Opus. Opus was craving a good fishy breakfast. Opus came across an undersea volcano and decided that would be his
stove. However all the fishes he normally liked to consume were still sleeping and he found it rude to devour an innocent exhausted fish. Now, Opus dug his head into the sand and pondered what he should
eat for breakfast. Because he had taken a very ostrich like position to do his pondering, Opus decided he wanted eggs for breakfast. But where could he find eggs so far under the ocean, where no birds 
lived? He realized his friend Skater, a shark like individual, had laid his eggs in the ocean bed recently. Opus decided Skater wouldn't mind if he ate one of her many egg babies. So he set out to find
that egg for his breakfast. 

In order to stole the eggs laid by Skater, Opus pretended to chat with Skater. "Hello Skater, how is the weather today?" said Opus. Skater was happy to see the old friend Opus. He greeted Opus and pointed his eggs said "My baby eggs! I will become a father in few days.". Opus nodded. "Could you please help me to take care of my eggs? I'm so tired to look after them." said Skater. Opus rushed into his heart and immediately agreed. Without the protection of their father Skater, eggs are vulnerable. Opus stolen one of the eggs and hiden it under his tentacles. "Perfect" Opus said to himself.
