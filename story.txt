One day an octopus was trying to cook some breakfast underneath the ocean. His name was Opus. Opus was craving a good fishy breakfast. Opus came across an undersea volcano and decided that would be his
stove. However all the fishes he normally liked to consume were still sleeping and he found it rude to devour an innocent exhausted fish. Now, Opus dug his head into the sand and pondered what he should
eat for breakfast. Because he had taken a very ostrich like position to do his pondering, Opus decided he wanted eggs for breakfast. But where could he find eggs so far under the ocean, where no birds 
lived? He realized his friend Skater, a shark like individual, had laid his eggs in the ocean bed recently. Opus decided Skater wouldn't mind if he ate one of her many egg babies. So he set out to find
that egg for his breakfast.
